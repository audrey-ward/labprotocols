# Field sample collection for isolation of yeast

## Introduction

_Saccharomyces_ yeasts can live in a wide range of environments and we are especially interested in characterizing the strains that live in the bark of oak (and other) trees, in figs and on grapes. This protocol describes how to collect small pieces of oak bark, fig, grapes and other fruits or flowers under sterile conditions.

## Equipment/materials
**Essentials:**\
camera\
GPS\
7ml tubes (e.g. for bark samples)\
30ml tubes (e.g. for fig samples)\
disposable gloves\
notebook\
pen (bic)\
permanent pen\
2 plastic bags for samples (ziploc) and rubbish (trash bag)\
ethanol 70 or 95% (<100ml)\
tape measure or string & scissors

**Useful extras:**\
spatula\
lighter\
forceps\
binoculars\
trash bags\
blue roll or tissues\
umbrella\
plant identification book\
50ml tubes\
map


## Health and safety and other precautions
Gloves should be worn when handling samples or when touching the tree. Depending on where you are: sunscreen, insect repellant, hat, drinking water if it's hot. If it's hot, then remember to take breaks! 

## Procedure
Collecting bark samples from a tree that is visited for the first time:

1. Identify tree species and optionally collect leaves if unsure of tree species\
Optional (if unsure of tree species): Collect 5-10 good condition fully developed leaves and put all leaves for a tree into a labelled bag containing silica gel. These leaves will be used to further assist tree species identification on return to the lab and possibly for future DNA analysis.

2. Take bark samples\
Wearing clean disposable gloves, break off a piece of bark (approx 1g) and put in a labelled sterile 7ml universal tube. It is easiest if an assistant (also wearing gloves) opens the 7ml universal tube for addition of bark and closes it again. If gloves were used to collect a previous sample and are not very dirty, then spray with Ethanol to clean between samples. Use a compass to take two samples from the south side and two from the north side of the tree followed by a negative control. For the negative control, wipe your gloved fingers inside a sterile tube.

3. Record observations about parasites, insects or other animals around the tree, or the ease of bark sampling: it is usually easier to break bark off older trees and there are large differences between species.

4. Photograph the tree\
Take a photograph in such a way so that someone else revisiting this site can use the photo to identify the tree.

5. Record exact location of tree.\
Use a GPS device to record the exact location of each tree. Use Datum WGS84 (which is the one used by Google). If no GPS device is available, then use a map to record exact location of tree as precisely as possible, and draw a map of relative locations of different trees. Later use satellite images in Google Maps to pinpoint as accurately as possible the exact locations of each tree.

6. Measure trunk and record circumference at “waist” \
Using tape measure if available. If tape measure is not available, then cut a piece of string to the length of the circumference and add to the labelled bag of leaves and silica gel or filled sample tubes

Collecting bark samples from a revisited tree:

1. Take bark samples (see 2 above)

2. Record observations about parasites, insects or other animals (see 4 above)
