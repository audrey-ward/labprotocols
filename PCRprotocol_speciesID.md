## PCR Protocol for Species Identification using ITS primers
_Protocol adapted from Bensasson 2011._ 
- Using the New England BioLabs Taq DNA Polymerase with THERMOPOL 10X Buffer

Reagent |	uL per 25 uL 	| Mastermix (ex. 8 samples)
--- | --- | ---
10x ThermoPol Buffer |	2.5	| 22.5
dNTPs (10mM/each)|	0.5 |	4.5
fwdPrimer (10uM) |	0.75	| 6.75
revPrimer (10uM)	| 0.75	| 6.75
MQ H2O (Sigma) |	15.17 |	136.53
Taq (5U/ul) |	0.33 |	2.97

-	Always add 1 when calculating volumes included in Mastermix (MM) (e.g., 10 samples +1 = 11 * 5uL 5X buffer = 55uL 5X in MM)
-	Add 5 uL DNA extract (1:50 dilution) to bring to 25 uL total.
	  -	1:50 dilution: Add 10 uL DNA extract sample, 490 uL DNAse free H2O
-	PCR conditions for ITS primers (saved on the thermocycler):
    -	94°C 4 mins	
    -	35 x 94°C 40 secs; 55°C* 1 min; 72°C 1 min 20 secs
    -	72°C 7 mins
-	Check PCR products on gel:
    -	Use a 1% agarose gel in 1x TBE. 
    -	For a 100mL 1% gel, use 1g agarose, 100 mL 1x TBE, and 1.875 uL of GelRed (prestaining).
    -	Dilute GeneRuler 1kb Plus DNA Ladder w/ 1 uL ladder, 1 uL MQ H2O, and 4 uL of loading dye. Load 5 uL into ladder well. Load ladder on either sides of the loaded samples (e.g., wells 1 and 14 of a 14 well cast). 
    -	Load 2uL of PCR product + 0.4 uL of loading dye.
    -	Run for 1h at 80-85V. Record start/stop times and which voltage used in lab notebook.
    -	Vizualize using UV box.
